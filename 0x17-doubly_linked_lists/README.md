# Doubly Linked List in C

A doubly linked list is a versatile data structure in computer science that consists of a sequence of elements, each containing a data field and two pointers, one pointing to the next element in the sequence (forward), and another pointing to the previous element (backward). This bidirectional linkage allows for efficient traversal in both directions.

In C programming, implementing a doubly linked list involves creating and managing nodes, where each node holds data and maintains pointers to the next and previous nodes. This structure facilitates various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

The provided C code snippets offer a foundation for working with doubly linked lists. The structure definition, node creation, insertion at the beginning or end, and deletion from the beginning or end are illustrated. These basic operations serve as building blocks for more complex applications that may require searching, updating, or other manipulations within the doubly linked list.

Understanding and implementing doubly linked lists is crucial for mastering data structures and algorithms, as they offer advantages over singly linked lists in scenarios where bidirectional traversal is essential. The code examples provided offer a starting point for developers looking to incorporate doubly linked lists into their C programs.

## Structure Definition of a doubly linked list

```c
typedef struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
    struct Node* prev;
} Node;
